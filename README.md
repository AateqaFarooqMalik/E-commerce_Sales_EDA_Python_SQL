# Retail Sales Performance Analysis (Python, SQL Logic, Power BI)
## Data Analyst Portfolio Project

### 🎯 I. Project Goal
The primary objective was to clean and analyze an e-commerce sales dataset to provide actionable recommendations to the business stakeholders regarding inventory, pricing, and promotional strategies using Python, SQL Logic, and Visualization tools.

### 🛠️ II. Tools & Methodology
* **Data Preparation:** Microsoft Excel (Initial cleaning), Python (Pandas)
* **Analysis & Logic:** Python (EDA, Feature Engineering), SQL (Query Logic)
* **Visualization & Reporting:** Power BI / Excel Charts
* **Version Control:** GitHub

### 📈 III. Key Findings & Insights
The analysis successfully calculated three key performance indicators (KPIs):

| KPI | Resulting Insight | Recommendation Base |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Top Revenue Driver** (SQL Query 1) | Brand **Zara** is the undisputed market leader, generating the highest revenue. | Invest heavily in Zara's inventory and marketing. |
| **Seasonal Pricing Power** (SQL Query 2) | **Winter** products command the highest Average Selling Price (ASP). | Maximize profit margins by focusing on premium products in Winter. |
| **Non-Promotional Sales** (SQL Query 3) | Revenue from **Man/Woman** product categories (e.g., Jackets) drives significant sales even without discounts. | Protect profit margins by minimizing unnecessary promotions on these core items. |

### 💡 IV. Business Recommendations (Actionable Plan)

1.  **Prioritize Winter Inventory:** Increase stock and allocate prime retail space to winter goods due to higher customer willingness to pay.
2.  **Protect Core Product Margins:** Stop providing discounts on high-performing non-promotional sections (like Jackets/Core Apparel) to maintain profitability.
3.  **Capitalize on Zara:** Further invest in expanding the Zara product line and ensure continuous availability as it is the largest revenue engine.
